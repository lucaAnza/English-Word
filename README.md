   Each word/phrase comes with an English explanation and an Italian translation, denoted by the Italian flag icon (üáÆüáπ).

  {
    dayLabel: "Day 1",
    words: [
      { word: "Exempted", translation: "Freed from an obligation. üáÆüáπ Esonerato" },
      { word: "Humble",   translation: "Having a modest view. üáÆüáπ Umile" },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
- **`dayLabel`**: The day‚Äôs title (e.g., "Day 1").  
- **`words`**: An array of `word` objects, each with:
  - **word**: The English term/phrase.
  - **translation**: An explanation in English plus an Italian translation (with an Italian flag icon).

You can **add, remove, or modify** days and words as you see fit.
